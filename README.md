Evaluating the potential of Extended Producer Responsibility returns 
for a small local waste collection company through a brand audit of
riverine plastic waste in Durban, South Africa
======================================================================

# Introduction

This Master's Thesis conducted at the Global Health Engineering Group
at the ETH in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, focuses on determining the growth 
opportunities for a small-sized plastic recycling enterprise in light 
of the shift from a voluntary to a mandatory Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) policy in South Africa. To achieve this goal in 
the context of a small start-up in Durban, South Africa, a brand audit
is conducted to identify the top brands that can be targeted for 
financing or partnership opportunities. The company, called TRI
ECO Tours, is a small tourism and waste collection startup in Durban 
operated by Siphiwe Rakgabale.

# Research Question

What is the characterization by type, application, and brand of plstic
waste collected in the uMngeni River system in Durban, South Africa.

# Data

The data was collected throughout two months in Durban right before the
rainy season. The collection took place in 6 different litter boom 
locations throughout Durban. The locations were: Greenhub, Beachwood
Mangroves, Quarry Road, Johanna Road, Golf Course, and KwaMashu. The 
data gathered was the audit of the occurence of the brands washed into
the litterbooms. Additionally, the weights, the plastic types, their
categories, and their respective groups were noted.
