Evaluating the potential of Extended Producer Responsibility returns 
for a small local waste collection company through a brand audit of
riverine plastic waste in Durban, South Africa
======================================================================

# Introduction

This Master's Thesis conducted at the Global Health Engineering Group
at the ETH in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, focuses on determining the growth 
opportunities for a small-sized plastic recycling enterprise in light 
of the shift from a voluntary to a mandatory Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) policy in South Africa. To achieve this goal in 
the context of a small start-up in Durban, South Africa, a brand audit
is conducted to identify the top brands that can be targeted for 
financing or partnership opportunities. The company, called TRI
ECO Tours, is a small tourism and waste collection startup in Durban 
operated by Siphiwe Rakgabale.
